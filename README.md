# Jet_tagging
Jet charge computation using machine learning is an innovative approach in high-energy particle physics, specifically in the analysis of data from particle colliders like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The jet charge is a weighted sum of the electric charges of the particles within a jet, typically weighted by their transverse momenta. This quantity provides important insights into the properties of the originating quark or gluon and helps in distinguishing between different types of jets, such as those originating from up-type versus down-type quarks. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, researchers can enhance the precision and efficiency of jet charge determination. These algorithms can learn complex patterns and correlations within the high-dimensional data, outperforming traditional methods. Techniques such as deep neural networks, gradient boosting, and other supervised learning approaches are trained on simulated datasets to accurately predict the jet charge. This advancement not only improves the accuracy of jet classification but also aids in probing the fundamental interactions and properties of particles, potentially uncovering new physics beyond the Standard Model.
